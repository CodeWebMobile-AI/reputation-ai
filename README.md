# Reputation AI: AI-Powered Customer Feedback Management

**Description:** Reputation AI is a comprehensive customer feedback management solution designed to empower small businesses to effectively manage, analyze, and respond to customer reviews from various online platforms. By leveraging the power of AI, Reputation AI helps businesses improve their online reputation, enhance customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge.

## The Problem We Solve

Small businesses often struggle to monitor and respond to online reviews across multiple platforms due to limited resources and time. This can lead to negative reviews going unaddressed, damaging their reputation and ultimately impacting their bottom line. Reputation AI solves this problem by:

*   **Centralizing review aggregation:** Collecting reviews from platforms like Google, Yelp, Facebook, and others into a single dashboard.
*   **Providing AI-driven sentiment analysis:** Identifying the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of reviews to prioritize responses.
*   **Generating AI-powered response suggestions:** Providing customizable response templates to help businesses quickly and effectively address customer feedback.
*   **Offering performance tracking and reporting:** Monitoring key metrics like review volume, average rating, and sentiment trends to measure the impact of reputation management efforts.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Platform Review Aggregation:** Seamlessly integrates with popular review platforms (Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor, etc.) to gather all reviews in one place.  Support for new platforms can be added through configurable connectors.
*   **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis:** Employs machine learning algorithms to accurately determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) behind each review, enabling businesses to prioritize urgent issues.
*   **Intelligent Response Suggestions:** Generates context-aware response suggestions based on review content and sentiment, saving time and ensuring consistent messaging.  Users can edit and customize these suggestions before posting.
*   **Automated Response Handling:** Configurable rules-based automated responses for simple inquiries or FAQs. This allows for immediate engagement and shows customers they're being heard.
*   **Performance Dashboard & Reporting:** Provides real-time insights into key metrics like review volume, average rating, sentiment score, and response time, allowing businesses to track their progress and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Allows assigning different levels of access to team members, ensuring data security and compliance.  Roles can be configured for managing responses, viewing reports, or administering the system.
*   **Alerting & Notifications:** Real-time alerts for new reviews, negative feedback, or critical issues, ensuring timely action.  Customizable notification settings allow users to control the frequency and delivery method of alerts.
*   **Reputation Score Tracking:**  Calculates and tracks a proprietary "Reputation Score" based on review data, giving businesses a clear understanding of their overall online reputation.
*   **API Access:**  Provides a RESTful API for seamless integration with other business applications and workflows.  API documentation is provided via Swagger/OpenAPI specification.

## Environment Setup

1.  **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Configure the `.env` file:**

    *   **Database:**  Set `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` to match your MySQL or PostgreSQL database configuration.
    *   **Redis:** Set `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, and `REDIS_PASSWORD` if you are using Redis for queueing.
    *   **OpenAI:** Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key (if using AI features).
    *   **APP_URL**: Set to your application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
    *   **APP_DEBUG**: Set to `true` for development environments and `false` for production environments.

3.  **Generate the application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5.  **Seed the database (optional):** You can seed the database with some sample data using:

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

## Development Workflow

1.  **Start the Laravel development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

2.  **Start the Vite development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Access the application in your browser:** Navigate to the URL configured in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## Testing Instructions

1.  **Run PHPUnit tests:**

    ```bash
    php artisan test
    ```

2.  **Run Jest tests (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    npm run test:unit
    ```
    (Ensure you have configured the test environment properly. This may involve setting up a mock API.)

## Deployment Guide

1.  **Build the frontend assets:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to serve the `public` directory.**

3.  **Ensure your environment variables are properly configured on the production server.**

4.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --force
    ```

5.  **Optimize the application for production:**

    ```bash
    php artisan optimize:clear
    php artisan config:cache
    php artisan route:cache
    php artisan view:cache
    ```

**Docker Deployment (Recommended):**
