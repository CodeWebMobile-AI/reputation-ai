**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Architecture Assistant (Generated by GPT-4)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Online reviews are crucial for the success of businesses in today's digital landscape. However, managing reviews across multiple platforms (Google, Yelp, Facebook, etc.) is a complex and time-consuming challenge. Many small business owners, restaurant managers, hotel operators, and service providers struggle to efficiently monitor their online reputation. This often results in:

*   **Unaddressed Negative Reviews:**  Negative reviews can significantly damage a business's reputation if left unanswered, leading to potential customer loss.
*   **Missed Opportunities for Positive Reinforcement:**  Failing to engage with positive reviews means missing opportunities to build stronger customer relationships and encourage further recommendations.
*   **Credibility Issues Due to Fake Reviews:** The proliferation of fake reviews undermines customer trust and can negatively impact a business's rating.
*   **Lack of Insight into Customer Sentiment:** Businesses need to understand the overall sentiment of their reviews to identify areas for improvement and tailor their services accordingly.
*   **Inefficient Review Generation:** Actively soliciting reviews from satisfied customers is essential for maintaining a healthy online presence, but many businesses lack a streamlined process for doing so.

### 1.2 Target Audience

This system is designed for:

*   Small Business Owners (e.g., Retail stores, local service providers)
*   Restaurant Managers
*   Hotel Operators
*   Service Providers (e.g., Plumbers, Electricians, Dentists)
*   Marketing Agencies managing the online reputation of clients

### 1.3 Solution

Reputation-AI is a comprehensive reputation management platform that leverages artificial intelligence to streamline and automate the process of monitoring, responding to, and analyzing online reviews. It provides the following key features:

*   **Multi-platform Review Aggregation:**  Collects reviews from various online platforms into a single, unified dashboard.
*   **AI-powered Review Response Generation:**  Generates intelligent and personalized responses to reviews, saving businesses time and effort.
*   **Review Sentiment Analysis and Insights:**  Analyzes the sentiment of reviews to identify trends and areas for improvement.
*   **Fake Review Detection:**  Identifies potentially fake reviews based on various factors, helping businesses maintain credibility.
*   **Customer Feedback Request Automation:**  Automates the process of requesting feedback from satisfied customers.
*   **Reputation Score Tracking:**  Tracks a business's overall reputation score over time, providing a clear measure of their online performance.
*   **Competitive Review Analysis:**  Allows businesses to compare their reviews and reputation against their competitors.

## 2. Design System

The design system ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across the platform.

### 2.1 Typography

*   **Primary Font:**  Roboto (Sans-serif)
    *   Font Weight: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)
    *   Purpose: Used for body text, headings, and UI elements.
*   **Secondary Font:**  Roboto Mono (Monospace)
    *   Font Weight: Regular (400)
    *   Purpose: Used for code snippets and technical information.

### 2.2 Color Scheme

*   **Primary Color:** `#007BFF` (Blue) - Used for primary actions, buttons, and highlights.
*   **Secondary Color:** `#6C757D` (Gray) - Used for secondary actions, labels, and muted elements.
*   **Accent Color:** `#28A745` (Green) - Used for positive feedback, success messages, and positive sentiment.
*   **Error Color:** `#DC3545` (Red) - Used for error messages, negative feedback, and negative sentiment.
*   **Warning Color:** `#FFC107` (Yellow) - Used for warnings, alerts, and potentially problematic situations.
*   **Background Color:** `#F8F9FA` (Light Gray) - Used for the main background of the application.
*   **Text Color (Primary):** `#212529` (Dark Gray) - Used for most text elements.
*   **Text Color (Secondary):** `#6C757D` (Gray) - Used for less important text elements.

### 2.3 UI Components

A library of reusable UI components will be developed using a framework like React. Examples:

*   **Buttons:** Primary, Secondary, Outlined
*   **Inputs:** Text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons
*   **Cards:** Used for displaying information in a structured way
*   **Modals:** Used for displaying dialogs and popups
*   **Tables:** Used for displaying tabular data
*   **Charts:** Used for visualizing data (e.g., Sentiment scores, review trends)
*   **Notifications:** Used to display system messages

## 3. Database Schema
